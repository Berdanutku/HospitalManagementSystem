# HospitalManagementSystem

The project is a hospital management system. The system stores many data such as patient records, doctor records, drug information and treatment information for the operations to be performed. Unlike manual systems, it stores this information instantly and does not allow for the possibility of wasting time and errors. The program also provides a lot of convenience in editing and changing existing information.
The aim of the program is to create an easy, user-friendly, cost effective and fast hospital management system.
